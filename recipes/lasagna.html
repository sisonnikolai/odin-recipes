        <h2>Description</h2>

        <p>
            One of the most loved foods in the world is finally here! This is a traditional Italian Lasagna, made the Italian way with layers of slow cooked Bolognese ragu and cheese sauce. 
            No ricotta &#8209; that is the American-Italian version.
            Lasagna, lasagna. How I love thee! It is possibly one of the most loved foods in the whole wide world, and understandably so. 
            There is just something so sentimental about lasagna, so comforting. It evokes images of of gatherings with family and friends all around the world. 
            It is the sort of food that is like a big warm hug, and so more-ish you want to keep digging in until you burst.
